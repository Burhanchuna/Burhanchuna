                            In this modern era Web development has become very advanced. Furthermore, one concept known as Responsive web design (RWD) is a very popular method
                            used in web development. Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development technique that allows a website's appearance to vary dynamically depending
                            on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. Moreover, RWD is one solution to the difficulty of designing for the wide range
                            of devices that users have access to, from little phones to large desktop monitors. In addition, it is a method of building a website that adapts its
                            information and elements to fit the screen size on which it is being viewed. It stops photos from being larger than the screen width, allowing users
                            on mobile devices to read your material without having to do extra work.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            Responsive Design is one of the very significant element which is related to web development. In simple words, it refers to the creation of websites
                            that adjust to the size of the visitor's viewport. Moreover, there are 3 main keys which makes the responsive design possible which are as follows
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Fluid Grids</li>
                            <li>Media Queries</li>
                            <li>Flexible images</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            There are several benefits of the RWD in web development as well. Firstly, there is faster mobile development at lower costs. Secondly,
                            higher conversion rates and easy analytical reports. Lastly, there is improved online as well as offline browsing experience. Moreover, it also attract
                            a lot of audience because people will access the website from a variety of different devices in all shape and sizes. Furthermore, Responsive web design
                            will accommodate it no matter how big or small the screen is. However, there are several webpages for multiple devices, any modifications must be applied
                            to all of them. Hence this way the RWD is related to the web development.

                        <p class="mt-4">
                            In my opinion I learned many things from the research such as developing web apps for different devices has 4 stages which are as follows.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Ideation Stage</li>
                            <li>Design Stage</li>
                            <li>Development Stage</li>
                            <li>Launch Stage</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            In the Ideation stage we have to first source an idea then do market research and lastly we have to define functionality. Furthermore, RWD comes in the
                            designing stage where we have to Sketch our app, plan our workflow, wireframe the UI and seek early validation. In addition, after designing the website
                            is developed and launched where we host and deploy our website.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            In conclusion, in WEB222 this term I learned a lot of things about how to create my own webpage by using several html elements, Java-script and CSS. In
                            my opinion, I enjoyed each and every assignment and completed all my test with a smile. Furthermore, a big thanks to our professor Tanvir Alam who taught
                            us all the concept so well and had a great semester with him as well. Finally, I perfectly learned the main 4 stage of web development in this term which
                            were ideation, design, development and launch stage.
